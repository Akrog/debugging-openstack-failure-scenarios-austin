# OpenStack Upgrades

---
 
## Overview

Three upgrade scenarios:

1. Upgrade everything at once

2. Upgrade one service at a time

3. Upgrade one service at time with a parallel Havana Nova
   environment.

---
 
## Scenario 1: Everything, all at once

- Simple because there's no orchestration involved
- Good for development or POC environments
- Not so good for real deployments because of extended downtime

---
 
## Scenario 2: Everything, one at a time

- Instead of one major service interruption...
- ...lots of smaller ones.  Yay!
- Schedule Nova upgrade separately from other services

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova environment (1)

- Like scenario 2, except for Nova
- Deploy Havana Nova environment on new hardware
- Share glance, cinder, keystone, neutron with
  Grizzly Nova environment
- Requires additional hardware

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova environment (2)

- Migrate workloads through attrition, or
- Migrate workloads via snapshot-delete-boot

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova environment (3)

- New Nova environment is set up in Keystone as a new region.
- CLI tools are happy (with --os-region-name or `OS_REGION_NAME`)
- Horizon not so much

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova environment (4)

Migrating an instance looks like:

    nova --os-region-name oldregion \
      image-create <instance> <instance>_migrate
    nova --os-region-name oldregion \
      delete <instance>
    nova --os-region-name newregion \
      boot --image <instance>_migrate ... <instance>
    nova --os-region-name newregion \
      add-floating-ip <instance> <ipaddr>

---
 
## Scenario 3: Parallel Nova environment (5)

- Reinstall Grizzly compute nodes as Havana compute nodes
  after all workloads are gone

---
 
## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron (1)

- What were they thinking?
- Configuration files have all changed location
- Python modules have all changed names
- Configuration files *include* names of Python modules

---
 
## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron (2)

---
 
## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron (3)

- What were they thinking?
- Quantum database has no versioning information 
  until you explicitly put it there
- So nothing as simple as `neutron-manage db sync`.
- Starting Neutron before database upgrade can break database

---
 
## Upgrading Quantum to Neutron (4)

- New `openstack-neutron` packages take much of the pain away
- Quantum client seems happy talking to Neutron server

---
 
## Upgrading Horizon

- `local_settings` substantially different between Grizzly and Havana
  packages
- Requires manual inspection
